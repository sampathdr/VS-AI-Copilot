### Description
In this course, we’re diving into a technology that’s reshaping how we build software: That is, AI in Visual Studio.
There are many tools the choose from, but be aware that majority of the the tooling we use comes from Github Copilot. 

GitHub Copilot is transforming how developers write code. But with so many features packed in, it’s easy to overlook what’s possible—especially when you bring GitHub and Visual Studio together. That’s where this course comes in.
