### Description
In this course, we’re exploring a technology that’s reshaping how we build software: AI in Visual Studio.

There are many AI-powered tools available, but most of the features you’ll use in Visual Studio today come from GitHub Copilot.

GitHub Copilot is transforming the way developers write code. But with so many capabilities packed in, it’s easy to miss what’s possible — especially when you combine the strengths of GitHub and Visual Studio. That’s exactly what this course is designed to help you discover.
