Please format all code snippets using 2-space indentation.

Use the Cascadia Code font when rendering code blocks, if supported by the environment.

When generating HTML, Markdown, or CSS, include inline styles or classes that suggest Cascadia Code (e.g., `font-family: 'Cascadia Code', monospace`).

Keep code examples clean and readable. Minimize boilerplate unless explicitly requested.

Prefer consistent formatting across all responses, including nested structures and multiline blocks.
